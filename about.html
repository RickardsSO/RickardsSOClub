		<p>The Rickards Science Olympiad Invitational, RSOI, was started in 2020 by Sina Mollaei and Dr. Hall with the mission of hosting an early competition accessable to all during the pandemic season.
        The first Rickards Invitational featured 45 division B teams and 67 division C teams. Last year we had 94 division B teams and 93 division C teams!
        The officers here at Rickards work hard to make sure we can have a smooth and enjoyable invitational experience for everyone. RSOI wouldn't be possible without the hard work by volunteers from around the country. 
        </p>
		<p>This season, RSOI is hosting our Division B and C competition from November 4th to November 11th in both Satellite and Mini Formats. More information can be found on our

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>High Quality Tests</b> that are not only challenging but also enjoyable to take.
                Our event supervisors are all competitiors and alumni that have preformed exeptionally at the state and national level
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fun Events.</b> One of our main goals is for competitiors to enjoy our competition and being an early season competition, we also want
                competitors to be able to bond with their team, therefore, we have trial events such as Anagrams, Anything Goes, Geoguessr, etc. 
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>An Enjoyable Experience.</b> 
                We want students to have fun while minimizing the workload for coaches. We prioritize prompt email responses within 24 hours and strive for clear, easily comprehensible documents. 
                Mailing list members will receive timely announcements for better coordination. 
                
            </li>
        </ul>

        
		<!--ul>
			<li><b>A stress-free competition experience.</b> 
                Our team of experienced student and alumni volunteers handles all aspects of each tournament, from event planning to test writing,
                freeing up coaches to focus on coaching their students. Our tournaments also span several days,
                offering your teams the flexibility of finding a time to compete that works best.
            
                
                
            
            
            </li>
			<li><b>High quality tests.</b> Our Event Supervisors are selected from a pool of the nation's most experienced competitors and alumni. Along with our Event Supervisors working their hardest to write tests that are both challenging and enjoyable, these tests are then carefully reviewed by our organizers to ensure that each is of high quality and adheres to event rules.</li>
			<li><b>Career-focused initiatives.</b> Computational skills and tools developed in computer science are becoming increasingly important for success in every STEM field, and through our <a href="/satellite/#events">Computer Science Initiative</a>, we uniquely feature an extended slate of events to help students hone their abilities in fields such as software engineering, machine learning, and cybersecurity.</li>
			<li><b>Equal attention given to all parts of the competition.</b> From event modifications and test evaluation to communications with teams and awards ceremonies, we give the same level of attention to all aspects of our tournament to ensure a competition experience that is uniformly enjoyable.</li>
