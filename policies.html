            <h3>General Science Olympiad Rules</h3>
            <p>
                All participants are expected to follow Science Olympiad Rules
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each division C team can have a maximumn of 7 seniors and each Divison B team can have a maximumn of 5 9th grade students.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each team must be registered with their State Science Olympiad to participate. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    Each team may have as many alternates as they wish, but the alternates may only participate in Trial Events.                 
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>RSOI Policies</h3>
            <p>
                These policies are also on the event modifications document
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This year, we will have normal length tests!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All note sheets (events that require 8.5 * 11-inch piece(s) of paper) must be printed out. However, online binders will be allowed.
                    </li>
                        
                    <li>
                        For note sheets, teams are allowed to have a page with different information for each competitor. Online binders need to be in the same document.             
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>SATELLITE ONLY -</b> Event Supervisors will keep track of "time out of browser". If a team spends more than 30 seconds
                        out of the browser, their coach must send us an email explaining the accident, or the team will be tiered
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Events that are supposed to have stations will give all questions at the same time to be completed within 50 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Participants may use any method of communication such as video call, voice chat, or the built-in Scilympiad chat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All events are 50 minutes long unless event modifications state differently.
                        No-shows will result in n+1 points.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Events follow <b>national</b> rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The final team score will not be influenced by trial events
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>


            <h3>
                Academic Honesty
            </h3>
            <p>
                We don't want anyone to have an unfair advantage in any event. Also, cheating is disrespectful to everyone in the Science Olympiad community.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Many events incorporate specific measures to prevent cheating.
                        In previous instances, we have identified people that violated these measures, and we would hate if you became one of those people
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>SATELLITE ONLY -</b> Event Supervisors will keep track of "time out of browser". If a team spends more than 30 seconds
                        out of the browser, their coach must send us an email explaining the accident, or the team will be tiered.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Coaches must ensure that their team is competing fairly and abiding by the established rules and guidelines to maintain the integrity of the competition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Please email director@rsoi.org if you are aware of any "cheating" from any team over the duration of the competition
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <h3>Appeals</h3>
            <p>
                An appeals form will open right after the awards ceremony when the test and keys are posted. If you believe your test was graded incorrectly or an answer was incorrect,
                it we will send out an email with the form and your coach should be able to provide you the link.
