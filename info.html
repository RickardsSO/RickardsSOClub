          We will be having both a Mini and a Satellite competition for division B and C.<br>
          Per the SIONIC website, those who wish to attend the Satellite competition must take the tests under the supervision of their coach
          and those attending the Mini competition must have all members be in remote areas. Our tournament is asynchronous,
          meaning teams can participate in the 50 minute events anytime during the competition. The tournament start Nov. 4 at 8:00 AM
          EDT and end on Nov. 11 at 6:00 PM EST

          We will be hosting a one week Satellite competition for division B and C.<br>

          We will also be having a 1 week mini competition on the same week if scilympiad allows - this will be confirmed by mid August. 

          Per the SIONIC website, those who wish to attend the Satellite competition must take the tests under the supervision of their coach. Our tournament is asynchronous,
          meaning teams can participate in the 50 minute events anytime during the competition. The tournament starts Nov. 4 at 8:00 AM
          EDT and ends on Nov. 11 at 6:00 PM EST. We encourage teams from the same school to take tests for a certain event at the same time.
